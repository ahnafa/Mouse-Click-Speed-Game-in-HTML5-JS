# Mouse-Click-Speed-Game-in-HTML5-JS
A mouse-only game designed to measure the rate of clicks in a ten second period. 

The core version of this game was inspired from the [following tutorial on Medium] (https://medium.com/@ssaurel/creating-a-click-speed-test-game-in-html5-2296751d0a97)

## Proposed Change-log
- Add text block containing game objective i.e "Meet or exceed a score of 70"
- Add visual effects to point of mouse click within the boxed area on the page.
